In this folder, you must add all the assets for the page on Microsoft Store, this includes the following:


1) A 71x71 icon to be used as the small icon on the results of the search bar. Must contain only the software logo and a background color.

2) A 150x150 version of the image above, following the same structure.

3) A 300x300 version of the image above, following the same structure.

4) A 1080x1080 version of the image above, following the same structure, but this one may contain some text, like the software name.

5) A 720x1080 version of the logo, pretty much like a game cover. This one can have details and text to cacht the eye's attention, just keep into the visual identity of the app.

6) A 1920x1080 banner to go at the top of the page, this one can be an illusration (like [Deepin Store](https://dstore-appstore.deepin.cn/international/index) does) or the app in action.
